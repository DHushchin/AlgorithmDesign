## Application for the [Dice game](https://gamerules.ru/baksy).

**Players:** This is a game for any number of players using three dice.

**Description**

Each player takes turns rolling three dice, and everyone continues to do so until one or more of the player's dice rolls "bucks". As soon as he makes a roll that does not contain "bucks", the turn passes to the next player.

Each player counts the number of times he has rolled "bucks". In each case, he gets a point. If, as he approaches 15, a player rolls that takes his score beyond 15, the roll does not count and he must roll the dice again.

Some throws are evaluated on a special scale. Three "bucks" in one roll are worth 15 points. The player who makes this roll is immediately out of the game, regardless of their current score.

Three dice of the same denomination that are not "bucks" are considered "small bucks" and are worth five points. 

Players strive to make "bucks", or a game (exactly 15 points). Having reached this score, the player is eliminated from the game, which continues until one player remains - the loser.
